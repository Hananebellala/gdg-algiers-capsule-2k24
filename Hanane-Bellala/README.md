# My experience with GDG Algiers

I joined gdg in my first year of Uni, that one year where you feel excited, lost sometimes, worried and have less connections or friends around you, but the gdg community made my experience much better. I connected with nice and talented people, sometimes role models, made great friends, learned a LOOOT and most importantly had so much fun.

I have been in different departements throughout all my 3 years and learned equally from each of them, also had the chance to participate in various events .

I wish I can give this community my best and contribute even more in the coming years.

and just like we say all the time , "GDG For once, GDG for ever"
 
```PS: I will be sharing some random pics, just from gdg local, or some events , etc etc, but whenever i look at those pics, i can't but remember the great times i had at those moments, so i am gonna leave them here ^^``
